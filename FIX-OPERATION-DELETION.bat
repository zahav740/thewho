echo Backup created

echo 2. Deploying fixed OrderForm...
copy /Y "frontend\src\pages\Database\components\OrderForm.FIXED.tsx" "frontend\src\pages\Database\components\OrderForm.tsx" >nul
echo Fixed OrderForm deployed

echo.
echo 3. Testing frontend build...
cd frontend
call npm run build >nul 2>&1
if %errorlevel% equ 0 (
    echo ✅ Frontend builds successfully
) else (
    echo ⚠️ Frontend build may have issues, check manually
)
cd ..
